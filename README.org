Sadman consists of random coding samples and sandboxed stuff which
help me to study & practice major algorithms and data Structures.

Everything in here is me testing stuff out(even this =README=), isolated
from the main project I am working on. So why have a repo for that you
ask ?  Its just so that I can copy and paste it in the future
.. /elohhel/

You won't find any readme's in any of the projects because I don't get
time to maintain them too. But you can open an issue and I will reply
to you on the same day guaranteed. üëç üëç .

This is a sandbox and I am *SANDMAN*

[[file:test.md][This is a test!]]

* Writing ~Readme~ s

Write =README= files as if you are explaining a younger yourself what is
going on in your repository, as if the person looking at your code is
a 6th grade student starting to learn +code+ programming.

As mentioned above, although no readme's(mostly) are written in this
repository, I will help you out if your stuck on something, don't just
copy and paste to create a sandcastle for yourself with my sand ha ha.
