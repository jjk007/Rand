Sadman consists of random coding samples and sandboxed stuff which help me to study & practice major algorithms and data
Structures.

Everything in here is me testing stuff out(even this readme), isolated from the main project I am working on. So why have a repo for that you ask ?
Its just so that I can copy and paste it in the future .. /elohhel/

This is a sandbox I am *SANDMAN*
