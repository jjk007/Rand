* This is me learning to build and use DLLs

All of the code and resources was taken from link below , thanks for
the code ‚ù§

*Remember to add the directory with dlls that is* =./libs= *folder into*
 *your system path*

These files where tested into windows 10 obviously because on Linux we
use .so files and life is much easier there.
