* Take away

So in *C++* a pointer of type =double= can point a double variable, an
array and a vector. This can become confusing at times.

You can write methods where it takes in a double pointer as an
argument and you effectively pass the pointer to a vector or an
array. While doing this make sure you also pass the size of the vector
or array as well because these information cannot be obtained from the
pointers we have.

Also note that:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp-mode
// if foo is of type double*
//then
double x = foo[index];
//is the same as
double x =*(foo+index);
#+END_SRC
