* Setup

This setup is to work with webpages which requires html files as the
output and can't run node server(For example a wealthica add-on).

Install browserify globally
#+begin_src sh
npm install -g browserify
npm install -g live-server # for easy "serverifying""
#+end_src

Bundle deps
#+begin_src sh
browserify index.js -o build/bundle.js
#+end_src

Since you have npm scripts setup in package.json, run it using
#+begin_src sh
npm run build
#+end_src
